## Clubhouse API for python

WARNING: Make sure to take a look at the source code before starting.

For reference and education purposes only. 

Note that the software comes without any kinds of warranty.

This piece of code was originally developed for the sake of interoperability, but was never used.

Currently, audio-related features (agora.io / pubnub) are not yet implemented.

Please note that you may get a permanent ban for invalid API requests. Clubhouse's rate limit and security mechanisms are quite strict.
